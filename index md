# 👋 Welcome

I’m a computational biologist with over 15 years of experience at the interface of life sciences, data analysis, and high-performance computing. I specialize in:

- Metagenomics & pathogen detection
- HPC and cloud-based workflows (SLURM, Google Cloud)
- Data analysis in R, Python, and Shell
- AI & bioinformatics integration

I’m passionate about applying reproducible, scalable tools to real-world problems in public health and environmental genomics.

## 🔬 Current Focus

- Surveillance of zoonotic and foodborne pathogens
- AI in microbial genomics
- Nextflow / Snakemake workflows
- Continuous upskilling in modern tools (e.g., transformer models, spatial omics)
